# 16: Basic Auth - app.js
##### restful HTTP server built with express, mongodb, mongoose, and basic auth
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bgwest/16-18-Authorization.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bgwest/16-18-Authorization)
## Current Features

These methods currently exist for creating, changing, deleting, and getting user data. This latest release includes the ability to signup and login using basic auth http/jsonwebtokens.

Updates to this API will continue to stream in as this project moves forward. Currently I am part 17 of 18.

#####LATEST: 
bearer auth middleware has been added and is being used on the new router image-router. this and all base CRUD features for image-router and is in preparation to start handling data.

##### Note: 
Using a database (mongodb) and ORM (mongoose) to perform the data processing, a new 'many' resource (schema) has been added called blog-post-schema.

Each user can now manage their user account and also create, update, get, and delete blog posts.

A user can now signup for a new account and receive a webtoken to be re-issued each login.
##### Also note: 
new npm scripts have been added including a bash script to easily manage the devDb: devDbOff, dbDevOn (see package.json)

##### working routes & their methods:
user-router.js,
blog-post-router.js,
auth-router.js,
image-router.js (w/ bearer auth middleware)
* PUT
* DELETE
* POST
* GET

*and all of their wonderful variations...*

##### Utilizing:
* express
* middleware e.g. body-parser
* mongodb
* mongoose
* jwt

## How To

#### Example testing with just jest:

```
npm run devDbOn
npm run justJest
npm run devDbOff
```

#### Example testing manually via cli:

```
npm run devDbOn
npm run start-server
````

## Image upload manual testing

*NOTE: make sure to create a bash variable for your token once you get it from a user signup. this will make your life easier and keep me from posting fake token over and over again.*

e.g.
```
echo 'export token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlblNlZWQiOiI1ZDI0Zjk4ZDliZGUwNzRiYjIzNTVhNTY4MWMyNDE1MDRiMTFlZmZhZTE4OWJlZGU1NTE4ZDY1OGZlMmFjODBkNTY1NzMzYTAxNGUyN2I1NmM2OTVjYmM2ZDgxZTQ5YWVlNWVjOWVkMmYyODM4Njg3NDMwZmIyZjhkM2U5MmIxZDY3YzBlNjE3NDBkMWFkMzg0NzRhMDMzODllOTE5ZDc5Y2E2NDBmOTQ1MjQwZmU2ODBmN2MzNDZlNDZiNzlhODAwNWEyYjZlOWZiOThiYjI2MmE3ZTBkZjVkOTY5MjMzMjVmNGQxODYxM2VlYjQzNDcxNjA1MDA4NTU5YTVkNGMzIiwiaWF0IjoxNTM4NzE1MjE1fQ.9onT3sRqD1S0aOryCMzhU2Vlr7yjGQSrGTNiMBv3kGw' > .token
. .token
```

*no . .token is not a typo. . (dot) is short for source. you can also import to your current bash env like: source .token*

*i would also make sure to use single quotes when writing your export. it's not full proof with all special characters but majority single quotes will be your best bet, depending on the character combo. Either that or double with all \'s (escapes).*

## Tests Performed with Jest

###### testing app.js routes and responses.

##### user-router.test.js

* 1: create user - should respond 200 and return a new user in json

* 2: attempt POST with no content to send - should receive 400

* 3: send GET for matching id - should respond with 200 && json a note

* 4: attempt 'valid' GET request with an invalid id - should receive 404

* 5: test PUT method - should return updated body && 200 status

* 6: test PUT method in the case where no body content is provided - should return 400

* 7: attempt user creation and then deletion - successful delete should return 201

* 8: attempt to delete with bad ID - should return 404

##### blog-post-router.test.js

* 9: creating mock blogPost with mock user, using super agent for PUT update, and response should be 200 status

* 10: create a mock blog post and try to get that post be sending it's id

* 11: create a mock user and send it a blog post

* 12: creating mock blog post / user and then deleting it

#### auth-router.js

* 13: test if 404 is returned if any route is invalid

* 14: test if 200 is returned with a token on successful signup

* 15: test if a 400 is sent body data is missing (e.g. username)

* 16: est if a 400 is returned when no creation data is sent (no body)

* 17: test if 200 and your token is returned on successful login

* 18: test for 401 status if auth fails (aka bad pw or username)

#### image-router.js

* 19: test - post request with a valid body and token should return 200

* 20: test - on post, if no token was provided, should return 401

* 21: test - on post, if no body was provided or if the body was invalid should return 400

* 22: GET - test 200, for a request made with a valid id

* 23: GET - test 401, if no token was provided

* 24: GET - test 404, for a valid request with an id that was not found

* 25: PUT - test 200, for a post request with a valid body

* 26: PUT - test 401, if no token was provided

* 27: PUT - test 400, if the body was invalid

* 28: PUT - test 404, for a valid request made with an id that was not found
